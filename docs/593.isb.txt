%        It was August, 1942.  The "Quit India" movement had gath-
% ered  momemtum.   Protestors,  all  over the country, came out in
% large numbers and the  thunderous  cry  of  'quit  india'  echoed
% across  the  nation.   The odd response of the British became in-
% creasingly brutal and what followed was savage repression leading
% to  unprecedented violence, lathi charges, and ruthless firing on
% unarmed protestors. The country was quickly  engulfed  in  flames
% and  Kasauni,  a small town in the Himalayan foothills was no ex-
% ception. It was in the midst of this savage turbulence that Nandu
% (Anil)  and  Rajjo  (Manisha)  met for the first time and fell in
% love.. a love that changed their lives forever.. a love that  was
% destined  to be consumed by the ravaging fires of passion and li-
% beration that swept the land.  Because, this was also the fateful
% time when a group of dedicated revolutionaries, led by the coura-
% geous and fiery Shubanker (Jackie), brought the spirit of freedom
% struggle  to Kasauni in prusuit of their sworn mission. Individu-
% als no longer mattered, all that mattered was commitment  to  the
% cause. And so began an immortal sage..  of people, of freedom, of
% duty, of conflict, of scarifice.. and of LOVE.
