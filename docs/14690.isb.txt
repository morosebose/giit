mahakii\-mahakii hai.n raahe.n bahakii\-bahakii hai.n nigaahe.n hai.n naa
%(the pathways are drenched in fragrance, the eyes are not in control, isn't it)

haay re haay re haay re haay re

ghere hai.n jo ye baa.Nhe.n paa_ii hai.n mai.nne panaahe.n hai.n naa
%(as these arms have surrounded me, i have found shelter, isn't it)

haay re haay re haay re haay re


gaa tuu dil ke taaro.n pe gaa giit aisaa ko_ii nayaa
%(sing, you sing on the strings of the heart, some song that is new)

jo zi.ndagii me.n kabhii ho naa pahale sunaa
%(that i had never heard before in my life)

palako.n pe sapane sajaa sapano.n me.n jaaduu jagaa
%(adorn the dreams on your eyelids, in the dreams create magic)

tuu merii raaho.n me.n chaahat kii shamme.n jalaa
%(you light the lamps of love on my pathways)


mere dil ne tohafe ye tum se paaye
%(my heart has received these gifts from you)

dhup thii Gam kii tum laaye saaye
%(there was scorching sunlight of sorrows, you had brought shadows)

merii ab jo bhii Kushii hai mujhe tum se hii milii hai suno naa
%(now whatever my happiness is, i have received from you, please listen)

tumhii vo chaa.Ndanii ho jo merii nazaro.n me.n khilii hai
%(you are that moonbeam, which has lightened in my eyes)

kahii.n ye to nahii.n hai.n vo aa.Nkhe.n hasii.n dekhatii hai.n jo mujhako piyaa
%(aren't these those beautiful eyes, which look at me, o lover)

jo bhii huu.N terii huu.N bas yahii gun hai meraa
%(whatever i am, i am yours, that is the only virtue of mine)


dil kii ye zid hai dil kaa hai kahanaa
%(this is the insistance of heart, this is what the heart says)

saath tumhare is ko hai rahanaa
%(it wishes to live with you)

chalo kahii.n duur hii jaaye.n na_ii ek duniyaa basaaye.n, suno naa
%(come, we shall go somewhere faraway, and construct a new world, please listen)

vahaa.N bas mai.n aur tum ho mohabbat me.n ham gum ho.n
%(may only i and you be there, may we be lost there in love)

ab ho ulajhan ko_ii ab ho ba.ndhan ko_ii ho nahii.n sakate ham ab judaa
%(now whatever confusion might be there, now whatever compulsion might be there, we may not get separated now)

ye teraa ye meraa aaKarii hai faisalaa
%(this is yours, this is mine, last decision)
