Parvardigaar-e-aalam, tera hi hai sahaara
Tere siwan jahaan me, koi nahin humaara

Stanza 1:

Nooh ka safina tune, toofan se bachaya
Duniya me tu humesha, bandon ke kaam aaya
Maangi Khalil ne jab, tujhse dua Khudaya
Aatish ko tune fauran, ek gulsitan banaya
Har ilteja ne teri, rehmat ko hai ubhaara
Parvardigaar-e-aalam....

Safina = boat. The first line refers to the story of Noah's ark.

Khalilullah (= friend of Allah) is the title of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham). He
was thrown into fire (aatish) and came out untouched. The third and fourth
lines refer to him. Gulsitan = garden; ilteja = wish, prayer.

Stanza 2:

Younus ko tune machhli, ke pet se nikaala
Tune hi mushkilon me, Ayub ko sambhaala
Ilyaas par karam ka, tune kiya ujaala
Hai do jahaan me Ya Rab, tera hi bol-baala
Tune sada Ilaahi, bigRi ko hai sanwaara
Parvardigaar-e-aalam....

Younus (Jonah) was swallowed by a large fish and later saved by God.
Line 1 refers to him. The second line is about Ayub who was afflicted with
sores all over his body and the third line is about Ilyaas.

Stanza 3:

Yousuf ko tune Maula, di quaid se rihaai
Yaaqub ko dubaara, shakl-e-pisar dikhaai
Behti hui nadi me, Moosa ki raah banaai
Tune saleeb par bhi, Isa ki jaan bachaai
Daata tere karam ka, koi nahin kinaara

Yousuf was imprisoned in Egypt and line 1 is about him. He was later
reunited with his father, Yaaqub (line 2). Shakl = face, pisar = son(I think)
 Line 3 refers to Moses parting the sea.

Saleeb = cross. Line 3 is about Jesus' crucifixion. The Muslim belief is
that he did not die on the cross.

Parvardigaar-e-aalam, tera hi hai sahaara
Tere siwa jahaan me, koi nahin humaara
