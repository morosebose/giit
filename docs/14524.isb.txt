kaliyo.n sii palake.n hai.n palako.n me.n kaajal hai
%(the eyelids are like buds, there is black decorative paste in the eyelids)

chaa.Ndanii saa cheharaa hai kaise sa.mbhaale.n dil
%(the face is like moonlight, how do i control my heart)

zulfe.n ghaTaa_o.n sii gaalo.n pe kaalaa til
%(the hairlocks are like clouds, there is black mole on cheeks)

kamasin adaaye.n hai.n kaise sa.mbhaale.n dil
%(there are childish styles, how do i control my heart)


khilatii javaanii hai rut bhii suhaanii hai
%(the adulthood is blooming, the season is also enchanting)

phuulo.n ke cheharo.n pe kis kii kahaanii hai
%(whose story is there on the face of the flowers)

pa.nchhii kii tarah kyuu.N chaahate.n hai.n cha.nchal
%(why the loves are mischievious like birds)

ThaNDii havaa_o.n me.n aaj kaisii halachal
%(what type of movement is there in the cold winds)


ho.nTho.n pe chhalakii hai ikaraar kii shabanam
%(the dew of agreement has overflown on your lips)

tere Kayaalo.n me.n hai pyaar kii saragam
%(the octave of love is there in your thoughts)

laharaa rahaa hai yuu.N kaamanii kaa aa.Nchal
%(the scarf of the beautiful lady is wavering as if)

laharaa rahaa jaise nadiyaa kaa nirmal jal
%(the clean water of river is wavering)
