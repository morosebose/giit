%	An an 'extra' in this series, here is a song picturised (not
%fully on Dev but) on one of Dev's most successful discoveries, Zeenat.
%He introduced many new faces in Hindi films and still continues to do
%so..
%
%This song is from 'Hare Rama Hare Krishna', the movie in which Dev
%introduced Zeenat Aman, who was Miss India then.  She was cast as
%Dev's sister, who gets into bad company. Zeenat had the looks to carry
%this semi-westernised role to perfection.  Dev Anand was a little
%dissappointed when Zeenat shifted camps and acted in Raj Kapoor's
%'Satyam Shivam Sundaram'.  His other famous discovery was Tina Munim.
%
%	Here is the song where Zeenat makes her first appearance.
%(I have no particular interest in this song but it certainly was
%a popular one when the movie was released - although it was the
%cause of some raised eyebrows! :)  
%
%	The popular R.D.Burman-Asha combo here for you... :)
