sun le o jaanam mai.n huu.N paramashivam
%(o life, listen, i am lord shiva)

tuu hai paarvatii milanaa janam\-janam
%(you are parvati, we have to meet in life after life)

sun le miinaakshii tuu hii meraa dil
%(listen o meenakshi, you are my heart)

luuT ke yuu.N mujhako chup kyuu.N hai qaatil
%(having looted me like this, whay are you silent, o killer)


pyaar kaa desh bhalaa puunam kii raat bhalii
%(the country of love is good, the night of full moon is good)

tum sa.ng mere piyaa pyaar kii do baat bhalii
%(with you, talking two sentences of love feels good)

man kaa miit bhalaa ghar sa.nsaar bhalaa
%(the friend of mind is good, home and world is good)

kahataa dil meraa tum saa yaar bhalaa
%(my heart says that a friend like you is good)


sun le o jaanam tum se pyaar huaa
%(o life, listen, i am in love with you)

jab se pyaar huaa jiinaa dushvaar huaa
%(ever since i felt love for you, living has become difficult)


koyal sii bolii hai baadal sii zulfe.n hai.n
%(your voice is like that of a cuckoo, your hailocks are like clouds)

mujh ko jaan se bhii merii mainaa pyaarii hai tuu
%(my canary is beloved to me more than my life)

jab\-jab dekhuu.N tujhe naache man meraa
%(whenevr i see you, my mind dances)

pyaar kii rut aa_ii jhuume tan meraa
%(the season of love has come, my body is swinging)
