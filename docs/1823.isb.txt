% VERY good beats/tempo. Wonderful picturization as well.
% worth the whole movie itself. Much better to listen.
% I will go ahead and give an unexpected
% Monday afternoon (!) treat. Forgive me for going prose, but the movie
% is Roop ki Rani Choron ka Raja (old), and I saw it last May on video. I
% was in the most vulnerable phase at that time, engaged, separated, soon
% to be married and my 9th-in-a-row-Dev-Anand-movie.
%
% I saw the movie for one song 'tum to dil ke tar chhed kar'. This
% is one of those most intoxicating romantic songs I know of that a guy
% can sing to a girl, until I heard cute, young Waheeda singing the same
% when she was bit by the bicchuwa of paapi prem-wa-ka-rog.
% And that was mind-blowing as well.
% 
% What drove me crazy was this duet, towards the end of the movie, on the
% beach of Shivsagar (somewhere in Bengal, as per the story line) which I
% had not heard before! And when I told my then-fiancee, she said it was
% a stupid movie (she was refering to the new one!) only when I sent her
% the cassette of the song, did she confess of being proud to make her
% decision (about me :-) )   ... Kahin main jyada to nahiN bol gaya ?
% 
% Here it goes.
