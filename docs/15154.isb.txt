% Comments by Tarana: I know that I might be stretching things a 
% little when I call this song "less-heard". I know that this song
% cannot be a lesser known song - at least among the more
% knowledgable groups. But I have not seen many references to this
% song during discussions - or of course. to see a HMV collection
% with this etheral melody ! Lata is supreme here. Her control over
% the words, over her bhaav is so perfect that I would unhesitatingly
% point to this song as one of Lata's very best melodies of her career!
% Vinod has composed other lilting melodies with Lata - most popular
% perhaps being her melodies in Ek Thi Ladki. But this song from the
% 1950 stunner soundtrack Wafaa establishes the pair at their
% combined peak !

kaagaa re jaa re jaa re
more piyaa kaa sandesavaa laa re laa re laa re
kaagaa re jaa re jaa re

u.D jaa re o kaale kaagaa jaa saajan ke dwaar
kahanaa usane kar dii der kaahe jiyaa bekaar
binaa doSh ke o nirmohii
binaa doSh ke o nirmohii kaahe ruuTh gayaa re
jaa re
kaagaa re jaa re jaa re

duur des ke jaane waale le jaa mere bain
kahanaa tujh bin nain baaware rote hai.n din rain
merii dashaa dikhalaane ko
merii dashaa dikhalaane ko do nain mere le jaa re
jaa re
kaagaa re jaa re jaa re
more piyaa kaa sandesavaa laa re laa re laa re
kaagaa re jaa re jaa re
