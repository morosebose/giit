##hey you, I love you##

mujhako ye lagataa hai tere dil kaa kamal khilaa
%(I feel that the lotus of your heart has blossomed)

sach hai jab se mile ho tum is man kaa kamal khilaa
%(it is true that ever since you have met, the lotus of this heart has blossomed)

tuu hii tuu aa.Nkho.n me.n tuu hii tuu Kaabo.n me.n saa.Nso.n me.n basii ho tum
%(you and only you are in the eyes, you and only you are in the dreams, you are immersed in the breaths)

miiThii\-miiThii shabanam haradam barase jab se mile ho tum
%(sweet sweet dew is raining all the time, ever since you have met)

man me.n basii ho tum man me.n base ho tum
%(you are immersed in the heart, you are immersed in the heart)

dil kaa kamal khilaa jaan\-e\-man jab tuu mujhako milaa
%(the lotus of the heart has blossomed, o the soul of my heart, when you met me)

ho ho ho, ho ho ho, ho ho ho

chandrakalaa sii sundar merii jaa.N tuu
%(you, my life, are as beautious as the phases of the moon)
