% Kosh does not mention the singer. Bapu Watwe, an authority 
% on Prabhat, supplied the name to Mr Dhananjay Naniwadekar.
% Bapu Watwe's sister was married to Prabhat's founder and
% film director Vishnupant Damle. Watwe grew up in Damle's
% house, observed Prabhat's years at first hand during his
% school days and has written a book in Marathi on Prabhat
% Film Co.

% The source for the song is the film's VCD.

avadhapurii sab prem hii chhaavaa \-2
swarg samaan surang jamaavaa

bandhu dekh bandhuu harashaaye \-2
a.nkhiyan priit na chhupat chhupaaye

man so bhe.nT kare sab ko_ii \-2
nar naarin sab ai gat ho_ii

avadhapurii sab prem hii chhaavaa
swarg samaan surang jamaavaa

bandhu dekh bandhuu harashaaye
a.nkhiyan priit na chhupat chhupaaye

% the song ends abruptly at this point as Thakur thinks he
% should end his prayer and get on with other business of
% the day.
