gup\-chup baate.n karane lagaa tere badan se meraa badan
%(my body started to talk secretively with your body)

jiine lagaa mai.n marane lagaa chhuu liyaa mai.nne teraa badan
%(i began to live, i also started to die, when i touched your body)

pyaar kii aag me.n jalane lagaa kyaa teraa kyaa meraa badan
%(whether it was your body or my body, it started to burn in the fire of love)

chaa.Nd bhii chhup gayaa baadal me.n ho gayaa aur a.ndheraa badan
%(moon also got hidden in the clounds, the body had become even more darkened)

aa mai.n chho.D ke ye duniyaa tere dil me.n samaa jaa_uu.N
%(come, so that i can leave this world and to in your heart)

duur chalaa jaa_uu.N sabase tere paas mai.n aa jaa_uu.N
%(i wish to go away from everybody, and to come near to you)

Tukar\-Tukar yuu.N mat dekho mai.n tumase sharmaa jaa_uu.N
%(don't look at me in such an unblinking way, or i will feel ashamed of you)

%(i wish my heartbeats to make your heart beat)

Kud ko rokaa bahut magar kaam naa aayaa ko_ii jatan
%(i tried to stop me in every possible way, but none of the efforts succeeded)

aaj hame.n kuchh kahanaa nahii.n haa.N aaj hame.n kuchh karanaa hai
%(today, we don't have to say anything, yes, today, we have to do something)

chuTakii bhar si.nduur terii maa.Ng me.n aaj hii bharanaa hai
%(i have decided to fill in your hairs a small quantity of vermilion, today)

maa.Nge se hame.n jo nahii.n milii bas vahii chiiz churaanii hai
%(what we could not get even after asking, we have to steal that very thing)

pyaase mausam se kah do hamane pyaas bujhaanii hai
%(tell the thirsty season that we have to quench our thirst)

raat milan kii aa_ii to ban gayaa shaam\-saveraa badan
%(the night of consummation had arrived, the body has become dusk and dawn)

Dar kar apanii baa.Nho.n me.n bhar liyaa mai.nne teraa badan
%(feeling afraid, i embraced your body in my arms)

aaj hamaare ho.nTho.n par dil ki kahaanii aa_ii hai
%(today, the story of heart has come up to our lips)

raat milan kii aa_ii to ban gayaa shaam\-saveraa badan
Dar kar apanii baa.Nho.n me.n bhar liyaa mai.nne teraa badan

aaj agar ham duur rahe phir nahii.n hogaa apanaa milan
%(if we remain separated today, thenafter it will not be possible to consummate our relation)
