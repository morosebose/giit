% Comments:  
%   Before we have a new ( old ) argument from the Rafian club claiming,
%   'See KK could not sing classical, so they had to get Rafi'....
%   Let me repeat, what I read in a magazine..
%
%   In late 50s and early 60s, Kishore was so busy with his acting
%   career and signing films left & right, that sometimes he did not have
%   time to record his own songs, so the producers had to get Rafi to sing
%   some of his songs :)...
%
%   The scene opens with Kishore singing with Tanpura & Ragini just
%   sitting & watching him.
