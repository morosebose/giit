##this is the story of eternal love told by the heavens above##
##true love, those who believe in immortal love, is forever##
##angels always watch over them, people whose love is for real##
##love can't be fathomed down, it is deeper than any ocean##
##love's what makes a tear drop more precious than even a pearl##
##it's love when a smile is received like a thousand blessings from heaven##
##love can never be shackled by arms, no rules no reasons at all##
##love gives it always a smile whatever maybe the season##
##this is the story of internal love## \threedots

##senses go numb and there is pain in my heart##
##the light of your love is so set to depart##
##souls of true lovers never go apart, never apart, never apart##
