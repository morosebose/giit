ghanan\-ghanan ghir ghir aaye badaraa
%(the clouds have accumulated)

ghan ghanaghor kaare chhaaye badaraa
%(very thick black clouds have shadowed the sky)

dhamak\-dhamak guu.Nje badaraa ke Da.nke
%(the thump of the drums of clouds is echoing)

chamak\-chamak dekho bijuriya chamake
%(see, the lightening is flashing)

man dha.Dakaaye badaravaa
%(the clouds are causing heart to beat worriedly)

man dha.Dakaaye badaravaa
man man dha.Dakaaye badaravaa

kaale meghaa kaale meghaa paanii to barasaa_o
%(O black clouds! please shower the water)

bijurii kii talavaar nahii.n buu.Ndo.n ke baan chalaa_o
%(please don't draw the sword of lightening, rather shoot the arrows of raindrops)

meghaa chhaaye barakhaa laaye
%(the clouds have accumulated and have brought rains)

ghir\-ghir aaye ghir ke aaye
%(these have accumulated)

kahe ye man machal\-machal
%(the heart is saying this, so very persistingly)

na yuu.N chal sambhal\-sambhal
%(don't walk like this, so very carefully)

gaye din badal tuu ghar se nikal
%(the days have got altered, you come out of your house)

barasane vaala hai amarat jal
%(the nectar like water is going to rain)

duvidhaa ke din biit gaye bhaiyaa malhaar sunaa_o
%(the days of dilemma have gone past, o brother! play the music of rainy season for me to listen)

ghanan ghanan ghir ghir aaye badaraa

ras agar barasegaa kaun phir tarasegaa
%(when the juice will rain, who desires will then remain unfulfilled)

koyaliyaa gaayegii baiThegii muNDero.n par
%(nightingale will sing, and will sit on the boundary wall)

jo pa.nchhii gaaye.nge naye din aaye.nge
%(when birds will chirp, novel days will arrive)

ujaale muskuraa de.nge a.ndhero.n par
%(brightnesses will smile on the darknesses)

prem kii barakhaa me.n bhiige\-bhiige tanaman
%(body and mind so very drenched in the rain of love)

dharatii pe dekhe.nge paanii kaa darapan
%(will see a mirror formed by accumulated water on the earth)

ja_ii_o tum jahaa.N\-jahaa.n dekhi_o vahaa.N\-vahaa.N
%(wherever you might go, you please look there)

yahii ik samaa.N ki dharatii yahaa.N
%(only this one is some scenery, the earth, here,)

hai pahane saat ra.ngo.n kii chuunariyaa
%(is attired in a scarf of seven colors)

ghanan ghanan ghir ghir aaye badaraa

pe.Do.n par jhuule Daalo aur uu.Nchii pe.ng ba.Dhaa_o
%(mount the swings on the trees and swing high on it)

kaale meghaa kaale meghaa paanii to barasaa_o

aa_ii hai rut matavaalii bichhaane hariyaalii
%(the intoxicating season has arrived to spread greanery all over)

ye apne sa.ng me.n laa_ii hai saavan ko
%(it has brought rainy season along with it)

ye bijurii kii paayal ye baadal kaa aa.Nchal
%(this anklet jewelery of lightening, this scarf of clouds)

sajaane laa_ii hai dharatii kii dulhan ko
%(it has brought these to adorn the bride of earth)

Daalii\-Daalii pahanegii phuulo.n ke ka.ngan
%(every branch of the tree will wear the bracelets of flowers)

sukh ab barasegaa aa.Ngan\-aa.Ngan
%(the happiness shall now shower on every terrace)

khilegii ab kalii\-kalii ha.Nsegii ab galii\-galii
%(every bud shall now bloom, every lane shall now laugh)

havaa jo chalii to rut lagii bhalii
%(when the wind has blown, then weather is feeling comforting)

jalaa de jo tan\-man vo dhuup Dhalii
%(the sunlight that was scorching body and mind has now set down)

kaale meghaa kaale meghaa paanii to barasaa_o
ghanan ghanan ghir ghir aaye badaraa
