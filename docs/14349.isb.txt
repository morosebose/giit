jumbalikaa jumbalikaa jumbaa le jumbaa le 
maze kii baat suno dil kaa haal suno
%(listen to the interesting statement, listen to the narrative of heart)

mile jab un se nazar hu_aa kuchh aisaa asar
%(when eyecontact with him gets established, some effect like this happened)

dhak\-dhak naache hai dil siine me.n pal\-pal
%(heart is beating in chest as if dancing, moment after moment)

un kii nigaaho.n ne machaa_ii hai halachal
%(his glances have caused a turmoil)

ek do tiin chaar hazaar baar
%(one, two, three, four, thousand times)

ab yahii gaa_uu.N mai.n baar\-baar
%(now i sing only this, again and again)



aa.Nkho.n se jo usane chhu_aa to ham gaye kaam se
%(when he touched me with his eyes then i became unable to do anything)

bechainiyaa.N ham ko milii.n vo to hai aaraam se
%(I got restlessness, he is comfortable)

labo.n pe pyaarii sii ha.Nsii unake thamii hai
%(there is a sweet smile lying on his lips)

jaan pe hamaarii magar kaise banii hai
%(but, my life has got put on a stake)

ye sharaarat hai pyaar kii o divaanii
%(this is the mischief commited by love, o insane)

shuruu yuu.N hii hotii hai prem\-kahaanii
%(love story commences only in this manner)

sitam pe sitam Dhaate hai.n vo
%(he commits tyranny after tyranny)

pyaar bhii yuu.N jataate hai.n vo
%(he also expresses his love like this)

mohabbat me.n dekho thirakane lage hai.n kadam dil ye gaane lagaa
%(see, in love, footsteps have started dancing, heart has started singing this)


pahale kabhii dekhe nahii.n sapane vo aane lage
%(previously i had never seen, such dreams have started to appear)

haalat ye hai kii nii.nd me.n ham muskaraane lage
%(the condition is that, in my sleep, i have started to smile)

aa_inaa dekhuu.N to vo bhii aate hai.n nazar
%(when i look into a mirror, he also shows up)

unhii.n kii hai fiqar mai.n huu.N Kud se beKabar
%( my worries are only about him, i am unaware of myself)

qaid me.n hai ab teraa dil to kisii ke
%(now, your heart has got imprisoned by someone)

soch le tuu kyaa\-kyaa hogaa aashiqii me.n
%(better think, what all will happen in love)

soch ke nahii.n karate hai.n pyaar
%( nobody thinks of pros and cons before falling in love)

hone do jo bhii hotaa hai yaar

hai.n dil me.n uma.nge.n hai.n tan me.n tara.nge.n labo.n pe ye nagamaa khilaa
%(desires are in heart, waves are in body, this song has bloomed on the lips)
